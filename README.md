ft_convert_base.c & ft_convert_base.2.c (ex04)

Takes a number and its base (base_from) and the base to convert it to (base_to).

the function ft_convert_base(char *nbr, char *base_from, char *base_to);

1. validates the both bases.
2. Runs skips over the white spaces and deals with the '+' and'-' signs.
3. Converts nbr into a base 10 integer.
4. It then does the conversion to the base base_from before returning it.
